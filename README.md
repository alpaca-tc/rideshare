# ðŸ“š High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails
Rideshare is the Rails application for the book ["High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails"](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails), published by Pragmatic Programmers in 2024.

# Installation
Prepare your development machine.

## Homebrew Packages
First, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

### Graphviz
```sh
brew install graphviz
```

## Ruby Version Manager
Before installing Ruby, install a *Ruby version manager*. The recommended one is [Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Run:

```sh
brew install rbenv
```

## PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL 16 or greater is required. Installation may be via Homebrew, although the recommended method is [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com)

### PostgresApp
- Once installed, from the Menu Bar app, choose "Open Postgres" then click the "+" icon to create a new PostgreSQL 16 server


## Ruby
Run `cat .ruby-version` from the Rideshare directory to find the needed version of Ruby.

For example, if `3.2.2` is listed, run:

```sh
rbenv install 3.2.2
```

Run `rbenv versions` to confirm the correct version is active. The current version has an asterisk.

```sh
  system
* 3.2.2 (set by /Users/andy/Projects/rideshare/.ruby-version)
```

Running into rbenv trouble? Review *Learn how to load rbenv in your shell* using [`rbenv init`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

## Bundler and Gems
Bundler is included when you install Ruby using Rbenv. You're ready to install the Ruby gems for Rideshare.

Run the following command from the Rideshare directory:

```sh
bundle install
```

## Rideshare development database
Normally in Ruby on Rails applications, you'd run `bin/rails db:create` to create the dev and test databases. Rideshare uses a custom script.

The script is [`db/setup.sh`](db/setup.sh). Don't run it yet.

Before you run it, make sure the following environment variables are set:

- `RIDESHARE_DB_PASSWORD`
- `DB_URL`

You can do that by running `echo $RIDESHARE_DB_PASSWORD` (and for `DB_URL`) and making sure they have a value.

Review the [`db/setup.sh`](db/setup.sh) script header section for details on what the values for those environment variables should be.

Once both are set, run the script using the command below. This method writes script output into the `output.log` file.

```sh
sh db/setup.sh 2>&1 | tee -a output.log
```

Since you set `RIDESHARE_DB_PASSWORD` earlier, create or update `~/.pgpass` with the password.

Refer to `postgresql/.pgpass.sample` for an example row, then copy the example into your own `~/.pgpass` file.

When you've updated `~/.pgpass`, it should have an entry like below. Replace the last segment (`2C6uw3LprgUMwSLQ` below) with the password you generated.

```sh
localhost:5432:rideshare_development:owner:2C6uw3LprgUMwSLQ
```

Run `chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass` to change the file mode (permissions).

Finally, run `export DATABASE_URL=<value from .env>`, getting the value from the `.env` file in this project, set as the value of the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

Confirm that's a non-empty value by running `echo $DATABASE_URL`.

Once `DATABASE_URL` is set, we'll use it as an argument to `psql` to connect to the database. Run `psql $DATABASE_URL` to do that.

Once connected, you're good to go. If you'd like to do more checks, expand the checks and run through them below.

<details open>

<summary>Installation Checks</summary>

From within psql, run this:

```sql
SELECT current_user;
```

Confirm user `owner` is displayed.

```sql
owner@localhost:5432 rideshare_development# select current_user;
 current_user
 --------------
  owner
```

From psql, run the *describe namespace* meta-command:

```sql
\dn
```

Verify the `rideshare` schema is displayed.

```sql
owner@localhost:5432 rideshare_development# \dn
  List of schemas
   Name    | Owner
-----------+-------
 rideshare | owner
```

Run the *describe table* meta command next: `\dt`. Rideshare tables like `users`, `trips` and others should be listed.

If no tables are listed, make sure you've run migrations, see below!
</details>


## Run Migrations
Run migrations the standard way:

```sh
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Note that migrations are preceded by the command `SET role = owner`, so they're run with `owner` as the owner of database objects.

See `lib/tasks/migration_hooks.rake` for more details.

If migrations ran successfully, you're good to go!

# Development Guides and Documentation

## Troubleshooting

The Rideshare repository has many `README.md` files within subdirectories. Run `find . -name 'README.md'` to see them all.

- For DB things: [db/README.md](db/README.md)
- For database scripts: [db/scripts/README.md](db/scripts/README.md)
- For PostgreSQL things: [postgresql/README.md](postgresql/README.md)
- For Docker things: [docker/README.md](docker/README.md)

# UI

Although Rideshare is an *API-only* app, there are some UI elements.

Rideshare runs [PgHero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero) which has a UI.

Connect to it:

```sh
bin/rails server
```

Once that's running, visit <http://localhost:3000/pghero> in your browser to see it.
